# Tracklisted

Command line tool that scrapes a Discogs album link and automatically generates a Wikipedia [Track listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Track_listing) template.

Note that Discogs is user-generated and is [not considered a reliable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources#Discogs), so the information should be cross-referenced with other sources. However, this can be a good starting point for creating a Wikipedia track listing.

## Example usage

With the following command:

`python3 tracklisted.py https://www.discogs.com/release/24911627-Kerri-Chandler-Spaces-And-Places`

The output is:
